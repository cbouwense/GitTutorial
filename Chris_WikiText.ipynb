Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative [[graphical user interface]]s, and Apple's marketing commercials for its products received widespread critical acclaim.

Jobs resigned from Apple and created his own company, [[NeXT]].\n",

More executive job shuffles happened at Apple until then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] in 1997 decided to buy NeXT to bring Jobs back. Jobs regained position as CEO, and began a process to rebuild Apple's status, which included opening Apple's own [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in 2001, making numerous acquisitions of software companies to create a portfolio of software titles, and changing some of the hardware used in its computers. It again saw success and returned to profitability. In January 2007, Jobs announced that Apple Computer, Inc. would be renamed Apple Inc. to reflect its shifted focus toward consumer electronics. He also announced the iPhone, which saw critical acclaim and significant financial success. In August 2011, Jobs resigned as CEO due to health complications, and [[Tim Cook]] became the new CEO.

      "After Jobs' and Wozniak's departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called \"high-right policy\" named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to [[Jean-Louis Gassée]]'s mantra of \"fifty-five or die\", referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Carlton |first=Jim |year=1997 |title=Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders| publication-place = New York |publisher=Random House |pages=79–80 |isbn=0-8129-2851-2 |postscript=<!-- None -->}}</ref>\n",
      "\n",
      "This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high-priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Carlton |first=Jim |year=1997 |title=Apple: The inside story of intrigue, egomania, and business blunders| publication-place = New York |publisher=Random House |pages=117–129 |isbn=0-8129-2851-2 |postscript=<!-- None -->}}</ref> Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990.

      "An editorial article in ''[[The Verge]]'' in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has \"matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design\" and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating \"Yes, iteration is boring. But it's also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success\". He acknowledges that people are wishing for the \"excitement of revolution\", but argues that people want \"the comfort that comes with harmony\". Furthermore, he writes that \"a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned\", referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity).

      "''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in June 2017 that Apple's increased reliance on [[Siri]], its [[Virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)|virtual personal assistant]], has raised questions about how much Apple can actually accomplish in terms of functionality. Whereas [[Google]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] make use of [[big data]] and analyze customer information to personalize results, Apple has a strong [[Apple Inc.#Privacy stance|pro-privacy stance]], intentionally not retaining user data. \"Siri is a textbook of [[iPhone|leading on something in tech]] and then losing an edge despite having all the money and the talent and sitting in Silicon Valley\", Holger Mueller, a technology analyst, told the ''Journal''. The report further claims that development on Siri has suffered due to team members and executives leaving the company for competitors, a lack of ambitious goals, and shifting strategies. Despite switching Siri's functions to [[machine learning]] and [[algorithm]]s, which dramatically cut its error rate, the company reportedly still failed to anticipate the popularity of Amazon's [[Amazon Echo|Echo]], which features the [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] personal assistant. Improvements to Siri stalled, executives clashed, and there were disagreements over the restrictions imposed on third-party app interactions. While Apple acquired an England-based startup specializing in conversational assistants, Google's [[Google Assistant|Assistant]] had already become capable of helping users select Wi-Fi networks by voice, and Siri was lagging in functionality.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tripp |last=Mickle |title='I'm Not Sure I Understand'—How Apple's Siri Lost Her Mojo |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-siri-once-an-original-now-struggles-to-be-heard-above-the-crowd-1496849095 |website=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |publisher=[[Dow Jones & Company]] |date=June 7, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Tim |last=Hardwick |title=Apple's Concern With User Privacy Reportedly Stifling Siri Development |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/08/apple-struggling-to-develop-siri-privacy/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=June 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 14, 2017}}</ref>\n",
